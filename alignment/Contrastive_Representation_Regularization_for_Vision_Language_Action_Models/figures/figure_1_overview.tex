    We extend the standard VLA training framework with a contrastive path.
    Embeddings from the pre-trained VLM are augmented by the \textit{view cutoff} operation applied on a randomly selected observation view, and optimized with our \textit{Robot State-aware Contrastive Loss} to attract samples with similar proprioceptive states, complementing the action prediction loss.
