    \textbf{Qualitative results on real-robot manipulation task.} 
    Under partial-view occlusion at the wrist view, the baseline model (left) fails to align the lid with the pot, resulting in inaccurate placement. 
    In contrast, RS-CL (right) achieves precise alignment and successful closing by effectively incorporating proprioceptive state information into its representation.
