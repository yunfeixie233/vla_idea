    \textbf{Alignment to proprioceptive states.}~ 
    We measure the alignment of condition representations inside trained VLA models, to the robot's proprioceptive states using CKNNA~\citep{cknna}.
    RS-CL successfully improves the representation alignment to robot states of VLA models, compared to the model solely trained with action prediction loss.
