\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we present \textit{Robot State-aware Contrastive Loss (RS-CL)}, a simple and effective regularization method that explicitly aligns representations with robot proprioceptive states. 
Our experiments demonstrate that RS-CL consistently improves VLA performances, particularly on tasks requiring reliable and precise positioning.
These findings highlight the importance of incorporating control-relevant structure into condition representations to enhance action prediction. 
We hope this work encourages further exploration of incorporating robot-centric signals, such as object pose or tactile feedback, to advance VLA models toward more precise and versatile robotic control.
