\section{Conclusions}
%
We have presented \modelname{}, an open foundation model for generalist humanoid robots. \modelname{} features a dual-system model design, leverages heterogeneous training data, and supports multiple robot embodiments. We systematically evaluate it as a generalist policy across simulation benchmarks and on the real GR-1 humanoid robot. Our experiments demonstrate its strong generalization capabilities, enabling robots to learn diverse manipulation skills with high data efficiency. We hope that our open \modellarge{} model, alongside its training datasets and simulation environments, will accelerate the community's progress toward building and deploying generally capable humanoid robots in the wild.
