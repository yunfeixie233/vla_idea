Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have garnered significant attention for their potential in advancing robotic manipulation.
However, previous approaches predominantly rely on the general comprehension capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) to generate action signals, often overlooking the rich temporal and causal structure embedded in visual observations. In this paper, we present \methodname{}, a unified and native multimodal VLA model that autoregressively models vision, language, and action signals as discrete token sequences. This formulation enables flexible multimodal tasks learning, particularly from large-scale video data.
By incorporating world modeling during post-training, \methodname{} captures causal dynamics from videos, facilitating effective transfer to downstream policy learning—especially for long-horizon tasks.
Our approach sets new state-of-the-art results across several widely used simulation benchmarks, including CALVIN, LIBERO, and Simplenv-Bridge, significantly surpassing previous methods. 
For example, \methodname{} achieves 95.5\% average success rate on LIBERO benchmark, surpassing $\pi_0$-FAST's 85.5\%.
We further demonstrate its broad applicability on real-world ALOHA manipulation and autonomous driving.
